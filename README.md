# ParkingAPP - License Plate Recognition Parking Management System

## Description

ParkingAPP is a Python-based parking management system with License Plate Recognition (LPR) capabilities. The application is developed as a project for the "Computer Vision" module during my Master's degree in Computer Vision at USTHB (University of Science and Technology Houari Boumediene).

The main goal of the ParkingAPP is to facilitate parking management using the SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) descriptor for license plate recognition. The system is designed to process images of license plates captured by cameras at the entrance/exit points of a parking lot and provide automated management functionalities.
